## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
1. If we were to use a different increment to increase how far the turtle travels such as an exponential or sine function, or just a more complex mathematical function than just +5, how would the pattern change?
2. If I wanted to animate the drawing gradually instead of completing each turtle's movement instantly, how could I modify the code for that?

#### Description Of The App 

` This app is a python program that essentially uses the turtle graphics library to create a cool, dynamic spiral pattern. There are multiple turtle objects, each with different shapes and colors, which move outward from the center in a coordinated fashion. As each turtle moves, it follows a predetermined path, updating its position, angle, and distance with each step. The result is a very vibrant and multi-colored spiral pattern and each turtle leaves a distinct visual mark on the screen as all of them are different. Overall the app shows the power of turtle graphics for creating geometric designs with code in less than 50 lines.
